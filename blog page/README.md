# Relaxr Pt2

### Description 

Relaxr was really impressed by your work last week and wants you to continue development on their landing page. Starting in class, you will work to build out a more complex layout for their company site. They decided on creating a blog, and their back-end engineers will be focused on developing the blog's functionality. They want your front-end skills to style their designs using HTML and CSS so Relaxr's engineers can begin integrating. Once again, the designers have handed you a basic [design file with instructions](design_file.txt) and the [JPEG](images/relaxr_blog.jpg) below to help you bring the blog to life. Submit the finished version for homework.

### Technical Requirements 

- Use the correct ```Open Sans``` Google Font typeface to style the text denoted in the [design_file](design_file.txt) and according to the JPEG provided
- Use proper filename conventions (lowercase, .html)
- Use a single external CSS stylesheet to style all pages
- Use a background image for the headers
- Add a hover effect to all the links using pseudo-classes
- Integrate drop caps using pseudo-classes

#### Bonus
- Link the "Blog" link in the header to the page you've built for this assignment
- Link the "About" link in the header to the [landing page](../../Week_02_Styling/Assignment/starter_code/images/relaxr_landing.jpg) you built last week
- Up for a real challenge? Use ```<script>``` tags in your HTML and [read ahead](https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-basics/) to make a dialogue box pop up when a user clicks "Sign Up Now!" that reads "We're Not Ready For Sign-Ups...Yet."
